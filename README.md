# better-code-of-conduct
Because "be excellent to one another" is woefully inadequate at best as a code of conduct. It says a lot about tech culture that a single Bill and Ted quote is non-ironically considered all that's necessary as a behavioral policy.

This Code of Conduct is an answer to this problem, drawn from my own experiences leading an open source team. Rather than just stating the "don'ts", it also contains guidelines and examples of desired behavior, and how they relate to team values. Thus it seeks to be a more comprehensive and holistic alternative to the typical boilerplate codes available on the internet.
